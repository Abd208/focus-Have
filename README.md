# Focus-Have
* Today I learned about the Focus Pass, which is a tool that allows me to access various AI assistants like Zee and Merisa or others.
* I also learned about Focus Jam, a platform enabling me to collaborate and communicate with my peers and colleagues.
* These are some of the features that make Focus a great app for productivity and learning.
# TPM (Technical Project Manager)
* I also learned about the FTA responsibilities, which include working as a TPM (Technical Project Manager).
* As a TPM, I have to plan, organize and monitor my assigned projects.
* I have to ensure that the projects are delivered on time, within budget, and with high quality.
